        <h4 id="id1">Rohit Sharma</h4>
        <p>It all began after an injury to an in-form Yuvraj Singh in the 2007 World T20, when Rohit was called upon as a last-minute emergency replacement to play a league game against the hosts. After a lacklustre start to the Indian innings, the 20-year-old strode out into Kingsmead and stroked his way to a fluent half-century against the likes of Pollock, Ntini and Morkel as though he were having a net session. He showed startling maturity under pressure to survive till the end of the innings, escorting India to a respectable total that they ultimately defended, knocking South Africa out of the tournament in their own backyard.
            Rohit was subsequently picked for the ODI team on a selection whim after his burst of vital performances in the World T20 and his impressive Ranji Trophy record. He made an impression in the CB series Down Under, playing some crucial cameos against stalwarts like Brett Lee and Stuart Clark, and a more-than-competent Sri Lankan attack. These inspired away performances in the World T20 and the CB series caught the eye of the selectors, and warranted him an extended run with the limited-overs side.

However, inconsistency and a knack of gifting his wicket away meant that he struggled to cement his spot in the side. Critics pointed out that he had too many shots for the same ball, and this meant that shot selection was becoming a bit of an issue for him. Furthermore, several experts spotted that he had trouble playing the short ball since his stance was too side-on and that he had no back-and-across trigger movement. His pedestrian batting average of 22 to go with a string of low scores and unconverted starts meant that he failed to cement a spot in the side for the 2011 Cricket World Cup squad...

        <h4 id="id2">Shubham Gill</h4>
        <p>Shubman Gill is the latest prodigy of India's familial batting production line. He shot to fame with 418 runs at an average of 104.50 in the 2018 ICC U19 World Cup, where he served as Prithvi Shaw's deputy and batted at No. 3 to play a crucial role in India's record fourth world title. Also the edition's Player of the Tournament, Gill was a favourite in the 2018 IPL auctions and was picked by Kolkata Knight Riders for INR 1.8 crore (USD 280,000).</p>
<br>
<h4 id="id3">Virat Kohli</h4>
<p>A spunky, chubby teenager with gelled hair shot to fame after leading India to glory in the Under-19 World Cup at Kuala Lumpur in early 2008. In an Indian team filled with saint-like icons worthy of their own hagiographies, Virat Kohli, with his most un-Indian, 'bad-boy' intensity, would clearly be an outcast.</p>
<br>
<h4 id="id3">Ishan Kishon</h4>
<p>Prodigies aren't uncommon in Indian cricket. What's unusual in Ishan Kishan's journey is the fact that it's roots originate in Jharkhand. With MS Dhoni - the biggest and perhaps only noteworthy name to have come out of the newly carved out state, it's no surprise that the young kid took to become a wicket-keeping batsman.

<br>
<h4 id="id4">Suryakumar Yadav</h4>
<p>Suryakumar Yadav made his first-class debut against Delhi during the 2010-11 Ranji season. He had a great start to his career as he top-scored for Mumbai with a ell compiled 73 and was the only player to score a fifty in Mumbai's first innings. Since then, he has been a regular member of the side and has scored reasonably well in every season.</p>
