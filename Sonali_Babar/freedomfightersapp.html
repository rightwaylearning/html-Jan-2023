        <h4 id="id1">Mahatma Gandhi</h4>
            <img src="mahatmagandhi.jpeg" alt="" width="200px" height="200px">
            <p>Rabindranath Tagore was the first person who used the word  ‘Mahatma’ for Gandhiji. Meaning of word ‘Mahatma’ in a Sanskrit " Great soul’. His great thoughts and ideologies made people honour him for calling him ‘Mahatma Gandhi’. And just like the title bestowed upon him, his sacrifices for the country and his struggles to make his beliefs a reality is a matter of great pride for Indians all over the world.


            He was raised in a Hindu family and ate simple vegetarian food. His father Karamchand Uttamchand Gandhi was the Dewan of Porbandar State. In South Africa, he was the first to start a nonviolent protest movement, it made him different from other protesters. Mahatma Gandhi also created the concept of Satyagraha which is a nonviolent way of protesting injustice. He spent 20 years of his life in South Africa fighting for discrimination. 
            
            
            His ideology of ‘Ahimsa’ meaning not to injure anyone was highly appreciated and was also followed by many great personalities around the globe. He became the person who could not be defeated under any circumstances. Mahatma Gandhi started the ‘Khadi Movement’ to push the use of fibers like khadi or jute. ‘Khadi Movement was part of the greatest movement, the “Non-co-operation Movement” which encouraged the use of Indian goods and stopped the use of foreign goods. Mahatma Gandhi was a strong supporter of agriculture and motivated people to do agricultural works. He inspired Indian people for manual labor and said that they should arrange all the resources ownself for living a simple life and becoming self-dependent. He started weaving cotton clothes through the use of Charkha in order to avoid the use of foreign goods and promote the use of Swadeshi goods among Indians.  
            
            
            In those days of the struggle for Indian Independence, Gandhiji suffered and was imprisoned several times with his followers, but freedom of his motherland remained his main goal. Even after getting in prison, he never used the path of violence. 
            
            
            Mahatma Gandhi’s contribution to various social issues could never be ignored. His drive against ‘untouchability’ during his imprisonment in the Yerwada Jail, where he went on fast against the age-old evil of ‘untouchability’ in society, had greatly helped the community’s upliftment in the modern era. He also advocated the importance of education, cleanliness, health and equality in society. 
            
            
            These qualities made him a man with a great soul and justified his journey from Gandhi to Mahatma. He guided many freedom struggles and found the “Quit India Movement.” The Quit India Movement was a great success. His death was the greatest storm to the forces of peace and democracy. His death left a great vacuum in the life of the nation.
            
            
            Mahatma Gandhi was the man who majorly contributed to the independence of India from British rule. He spent his entire life serving his country and its people, and the international arena was the face of Indian leadership. He was a man of ethics, values, and discipline who motivates and encourages young people worldwide even today. </p>

            <img src="netajisubhash.jpg" alt="" width="200px" height="200px">
            <p>Subhas Chandra Bose (/ʃʊbˈhɑːs ˈtʃʌndrə ˈboʊs/ (listen) shuub-HAHSS CHUN-drə BOHSS;[12] 23 January 1897 – 18 August 1945[4][5]) was an Indian nationalist whose defiance of British authority in India made him a hero among many Indians,[h][i][j] but his wartime alliances with Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan left a legacy vexed by authoritarianism,[16][k][l][m][n] anti-Semitism,[o][p][q][23] and military failure.[r][26][27][s][t] The honorific Netaji (Hindi: "Respected Leader") was first applied to Bose in Germany in early 1942—by the Indian soldiers of the Indische Legion and by the German and Indian officials in the Special Bureau for India in Berlin. It is now used throughout India.[u]

            Subhas Bose was born into wealth and privilege in a large Bengali family in Orissa during the British Raj. The early recipient of an Anglocentric education, he was sent after college to England to take the Indian Civil Service examination. He succeeded with distinction in the vital first exam but demurred at taking the routine final exam, citing nationalism to be a higher calling. Returning to India in 1921, Bose joined the nationalist movement led by Mahatma Gandhi and the Indian National Congress. He followed Jawaharlal Nehru to leadership in a group within the Congress which was less keen on constitutional reform and more open to socialism.[v] Bose became Congress president in 1938. After reelection in 1939, differences arose between him and the Congress leaders, including Gandhi, over the future federation of British India and princely states, but also because discomfort had grown among the Congress leadership over Bose's negotiable attitude to non-violence, and his plans for greater powers for himself.[32] After the large majority of the Congress Working Committee members resigned in protest
            ,[33] Bose resigned as president and was eventually ousted from the party.[34][35][36]</p>

            <p>Lala Lajpat Rai (Devanagari: लाला लाजपत राय) (28 January 1865 - 17 November 1928) was an Indian author, freedom fighter, and politician. He played a vital role in the Indian Independence movement. He was popularly known as Punjab Kesari. He is also known as 'Punjab da Sher' which literally means the 'Lion of Punjab'. He was one of the three members of the Lal Bal Pal trimurti.[1] He was also associated with management activities of Punjab National Bank in early years and Lakshmi Insurance Company in their early stages in 1894. He died of a severe head injury after 18 days of trauma injuries during a baton charge by police in Lahore, when he led a peaceful protest march against the all-British Simon Commission Indian constitutional reforms.</p>

        <h4 id="id4">Pandit Jawaharlal Neheru</h4>
            <img src="panditjawaharlal.jpg" alt="" width="200px" height="200px">
            <p>Jawaharlal Nehru (/ˈneɪruˌˈnɛru/;[1] Hindi: [ˈdʒəʋɑːɦəɾˈlɑːl ˈneːɦɾuː] (listen); juh-WAH-hurr-LAHL NE-hǝ-ROO; 14 November 1889 – 27 May 1964) was an Indian anti-colonial nationalist, secular humanist, social democrat,[2] statesman and author who was a central figure in India during the middle of the 20th century. Nehru was a principal leader of the Indian nationalist movement in the 1930s and 1940s. Upon India's independence in 1947, he became the 1st Prime Minister of India, serving for 16 years. Nehru promoted parliamentary democracy, secularism, and science and technology during the 1950s, powerfully influencing India's arc as a modern nation. In international affairs, he steered India clear of the two blocs of the Cold War. A well-regarded author, his books written in prison, such as Letters from a Father to His Daughter (1929), An Autobiography (1936) and The Discovery of India (1946), have been read around the world. The honorific Pandit has been commonly applied before his name.

                The son of Motilal Nehru, a prominent lawyer and Indian nationalist, Jawaharlal Nehru was educated in England—at Harrow School and Trinity College, Cambridge, and trained in the law at the Inner Temple. He became a barrister, returned to India, enrolled at the Allahabad High Court and gradually began to take an interest in national politics, which eventually became a full-time occupation. He joined the Indian National Congress, rose to become the leader of a progressive faction during the 1920s, and eventually of the Congress, receiving the support of Mahatma Gandhi who was to designate Nehru as his political heir. As Congress president in 1929, Nehru called for complete independence from the British Raj. Nehru and the Congress dominated Indian politics during the 1930s. Nehru promoted the idea of the secular nation-state in the 1937 Indian provincial elections, allowing the Congress to sweep the elections, and to form governments in several provinces. In September 1939, the Congress ministries resigned to protest Viceroy Lord Linlithgow's decision to join the war without consulting them. After the All India Congress Committee's Quit India Resolution of 8 August 1942, senior Congress leaders were imprisoned and for a time the organisation was crushed. Nehru, who had reluctantly heeded Gandhi's call for immediate independence, and had desired instead to support the Allied war effort during World War II, came out of a lengthy prison term to a much altered political landscape. The Muslim League, under Muhammad Ali Jinnah, had come to dominate Muslim politics in the interim. In the 1946 provincial elections, Congress won the elections but the League won all the seats reserved for Muslims, which the British interpreted to be a clear mandate for Pakistan in some form. Nehru became the interim prime minister
                 of India in September 1946, with the League joining his government with some hesitancy in October 1946.</p>

            <p>Sukhdev Thapar was a member of the Hindustan Socialist Republican Association (HSRA) and Naujawan Bharat Sabha (NJSB), and organised revolutionary cells in Punjab and other areas of North India.[3] He was the chief of Punjab unit of HSRA and instrumental in taking decisions.

                Sukhdev participated in numerous revolutionary activities such as a prison hunger strike in 1929; he is best known for his assaults in the Lahore Conspiracy Case (1929–30).[4] He is best remembered for his involvement in the assassination of Assistant Superintendent of Police, J. P. Saunders, on 17 December 1928, by Bhagat Singh and Shivaram Rajguru,[3] undertaken in response to the violent death of the veteran leader Lala Lajpat Rai.[3]
                
                Lahore Conspiracy Case
                Sukhdev was the prime accused in the Lahore Conspiracy Case of 1929, whose official title was "Crown versus Sukhdev and others." The first information report (FIR) of the case, filed by Hamilton Harding, Senior Superintendent of police, in the court of R.S. Pandit, the Special Magistrate in April 1929, mentions Sukhdev as accused number 1. It describes him as Swami alias villager, son of Ram Lal, caste Thapar Khatri.[1] After the Central Assembly Hall bombings in New Delhi (8 April 1929), Sukhdev and his accomplices were arrested, convicted, </p>

            <img src="vallabhbhai.jpg" alt="" width="200px" height="200px">
            <p>Vallabhbhai Jhaverbhai Patel (Gujarati: [ʋəlːəbːʰɑi dʒʰəʋeɾbʰɑi pəʈel]; pə-TEL; 31 October 1875 – 15 December 1950), commonly known as Sardar Patel,[a] was an Indian lawyer, influential political leader, barrister and statesman who served as the first Deputy Prime Minister and Home Minister of India from 1947 to 1950. He was a barrister and a senior leader of the Indian National Congress, who played a leading role in the country's struggle for independence, guiding its integration into a united, independent nation.[1] In India and elsewhere, he was often called Sardar, meaning "chief" in Hindi, Urdu, Bengali and Persian. He acted as the Home Minister during the political integration of India and the Indo-Pakistani War of 1947.[2]

                Patel was born in Nadiad, Kheda district, and raised in the countryside of the state of Gujarat.[3] He was a successful lawyer. One of Mahatma Gandhi's earliest political lieutenants, he organised peasants from Kheda, Borsad, and Bardoli in Gujarat in non-violent civil disobedience against the British Raj, becoming one of the most influential leaders in Gujarat. He was appointed as the 49th President of Indian National Congress, organising the party for elections in 1934 and 1937 while promoting the Quit India Movement.
                
                As the first Home Minister and Deputy Prime Minister of India, Patel organised relief efforts for partition refugees fleeing to Punjab and Delhi from Pakistan and worked to restore peace. He led the task of forging a united India, successfully integrating into the newly independent nation those British colonial provinces that formed the Dominion of India.[4] Besides those provinces that had been under direct British rule, approximately 565 self-governing princely states had been released from British suzerainty by the Indian Independence Act of 1947. Patel persuaded almost every princely state to accede to India. His commitment to national integration in the newly independent country was total and uncompromising, earning him the sobriquet "Iron Man of India".[5] He is also 
                remembered as the "patron saint of India's civil servants" for having established the modern All India Services system.</p>

            <p>Swami Vivekananda (/ˈswɑːmi ˌvɪveɪˈkɑːnəndə/; Bengali: [ʃami bibekanɔndo] (listen); 12 January 1863 – 4 July 1902), born Narendranath Datta (Bengali: [nɔrendronatʰ dɔto]), was an Indian Hindu monk, philosopher, author, religious teacher, and the chief disciple of the Indian mystic Ramakrishna.[4][5] He was a key figure in the introduction of Vedanta and Yoga to the Western world;[6][7][8] and is credited with raising interfaith awareness, and bringing Hinduism to the status of a major world religion.[9] Vivekananda became a popular figure after the 1893 Parliament of Religions in Chicago, where he began his famous speech with the words, "Sisters and brothers of America...," before introducing Hinduism to Americans.[10][11] He was so impactful at the Parliament that an American newspaper described him as: “an orator by divine right and undoubtedly the greatest figure at the Parliament”.[12] After great success at the Parliament, in the subsequent years, Vivekananda delivered hundreds of lectures across the United States, England and Europe, disseminating the core tenets of Hindu philosophy, and founded the Vedanta Society of New York and the Vedanta Society of San Francisco 
                (now Vedanta Society of Northern California),[13] both of which became the foundations for Vedanta Societies in the West.</p>

            <p>Rani Lakshmibai (or Rani Lakshmi Bai) was born on 19 November 1828[4][5] (some sources say 1835)[2][6][7] in the town of Varanasi into a Marathi Karhade Brahmin family.[8] She was named Manikarnika Tambe and was nicknamed Manu.[9] Her father was Moropant Tambe[10] and her mother Bhagirathi Sapre (Bhagirathi Bai). Her parents came from the Tambe village of the Guhagar taluka located in the Ratnagiri district of Maharashtra.[11] Her mother died when she was four years old. Her father was the Commander of the war of Kalyanpranth. Her father worked for Peshwa Baji Rao II of Bithoor district.[12] The Peshwa called her "Chhabili", which means "beautiful " and "lively and cheerful". She was educated at home and was taught to read and write, and was more independent in her childhood than others of her age; her studies included shooting, horsemanship, fencing[13][14] and mallakhamba with her childhood friends Nana Sahib and Tantia Tope.[15][16][dubious – discuss] Rani Lakshmibai contrasted many of the patriarchal cultural expectations for women in India's society at this time.[17] And she was known for her unique perspectives 
                and her courage to fight against social norms even in front of the whole society.</p>

            <p>Sarojini Naidu (née Chattopadhyay; 13 February 1879 – 2 March 1949)[1] was an Indian political activist, feminist and poet. A proponent of civil rights, women's emancipation, and anti-imperialistic ideas, she was an important person in India's struggle for independence from colonial rule. She was also the first Indian woman to be the president of the Indian National Congress and to be appointed as governor of an Indian state (United Provinces).

                Naidu's literary work as a poet earned her the sobriquet the “Nightingale of India”, or “Bharat Kokila” by Mahatma Gandhi because of colour, imagery and lyrical quality of her poetry.[2]
                
                Born in a Bengali family in Hyderabad, Chattopadhyay was educated in Madras, London and Cambridge. Following her time in England, where she worked as a suffragist, she was drawn to Indian National Congress' movement for India's independence from British rule. She became a part of the Indian nationalist movement and became a follower of Mahatma Gandhi and his idea of swaraj. She married Govindarajulu Naidu, a general physician in 1898. She was appointed the President of the Indian National Congress in 1925 and later became the Governor of the United Provinces in 1947, becoming the first woman to hold the office of Governor in the Dominion of India.
                
                Naidu's poetry includes both children's poems and others written on more serious themes including patriotism, and tragedy. Published in 1912, "In the Bazaars of Hyderabad" remains one of her most popular poems. She died of a cardiac arrest on 2 March 1949.</p>
