        Wikipedia is an encyclopedia that anyone can edit, and tens of millions already have! </p>

        <p> Wikipedia's purpose is to satisfy the curious minds by acting as a widely accessible and free encyclopedia that contains information on all branches of knowledge. Hosted by the Wikimedia Foundation, Wikipedia consists of freely editable content, whose articles also have numerous links to guide readers for more information. </p>

            <p> Written collaboratively by largely anonymous volunteers, anyone with Internet access and in good standing can write and make changes to Wikipedia articles (except in limited cases where editing is restricted to prevent disruption or vandalism). Since its creation on January 15, 2001, Wikipedia has grown into the world's largest reference website, attracting over a billion visitors monthly. It currently has more than sixty million articles in more than <a href="https://youtu.be/VeK-d553Mjk">300</a> languages, including 6,609,127 articles in English with 125,895 active contributors in the past month. </p>

                <p> The fundamental principles of Wikipedia are summarized in its five pillars. The Wikipedia community has developed many policies and guidelines, but you don't need to be familiar with them all before contributing.  </p>

                    <p> Anyone can edit Wikipedia's text, references, and images. What is written is more important than who writes it. The content must conform with Wikipedia's policies, including being verifiable by a published reliable source. Editors' opinions, beliefs, personal experiences, unreviewed research, libelous material and copyright violations will not remain! Wikipedia's software allows easy reversal of errors and experienced editors to watch and patrol bad edits. Begin by simply clicking the Edit button at the top of any editable page!
