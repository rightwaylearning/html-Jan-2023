    <p>aju are last and second last, respectively. At the yearly class photo, Rancho makes a bet with Virus that if either Raju or Farhan gets a job from on-campus interviews, Virus will shave his mustache.

        One night in their fourth year of college, Rancho tells his friends why they consistently place last: Farhan's passion is photography, not engineering, and Raju lacks self-confidence. After Farhan and Raju promise to confront their problems if Rancho confesses his feelings for Pia, the three of them drunkenly break into Virus' house. Virus spots Raju during their escape and, the next day gives him an ultimatum: to incriminate his friends or be expelled himself. A distraught Raju attempts suicide, but survives and recovers due to support and care from his friends and family, also leading to Virus revoking the expulsion. Raju is successful in a job interview, while Farhan convinces his father to let him become a photographer.
        
        Virus, in an attempt to protect his fragile ego, tries to sabotage Raju's chances of success by holding an unfairly difficult exam. With Pia's help, Rancho and Farhan break into Virus' office and steal the exam paper. Even though Raju refuses to cheat, the three of them are caught and expelled. Pia confronts her father over her brother's suicide, which was prompted by similar pressure placed on him by Virus. That night, during a heavy rainstorm, Mona, who is pregnant, goes into labor. Unable to drive to a hospital, Rancho modifies a vacuum cleaner into a ventouse and delivers the baby with the help of Pia, Farhan, and Raju. A grateful Virus acknowledges Rancho by giving him a valuable space pen and revokes the trio's expulsions. On graduation day, Rancho suddenly disappears.<br>

The film received mixed to positive reviews from critics and went on to became the highest grossing Hindi film of 2021 and 47th highest grossing Indian film of all time with a gross of ₹294.91 crore after the COVID-19 pandemic.[7]

    Plot

Bilal Ahmed, the blasts' mastermind seeks refuge with dreaded terrorist Omar Hafeez at POK, as they begin planning more such attacks. Omar's son Riyaaz has formed a sleeper cell network consisting of 40 terrorists who pose as Indians, aiming to conduct more bombings after the 26/11 attacks. Away in Jaisalmer, Sooryavanshi and his team nab Riyaaz who was hiding his identity. Joint CP and Surya's senior officer Kabir Shroff, who was the only person able to fully solve the case, reveals that about a full ton of RDX was brought to India, of which 400 kgs were used during the 1993 bombings and the remnant 600 kgs are still buried somewhere in the country.
    
    Surya, now DCP and ATS chief, plans to catch the sleeper cell's remaining members. He also tries to reconcile with his estranged wife Dr. Ria Gupta, with whom he parted ways due to a misunderstanding, but to no avail. Surya comes across Islamic priest Kader Usmani, in fact a terrorist and Bilal's aide. Usmani meets Bilal, whose residence in Sawantwadi houses the wanted 600 kgs of RDX. They remove the buried RDX and prepare for the next bombings. Bilal reaches Mumbai with the help of taxi driver John Mascarenhas who left for Bangkok. Surya catches Bilal, who confesses that he undertook the bombings as an act of vengeance for his family being killed in communal riots and shoots himself to death.
    
    Later, John is apprehended in Bangkok post a long chase between him and Sooryavanshi , who learns that the bombs were being made by another member of the sleeper cell. Usmani and John are arrested; Surya plans to pretend to torture Usmani's daughters to make him confess. Usmani finally reveals that Riyaaz will meet him at his aide Rafique's residence. A suicidal bomb planted there kills Usmani, whose elder daughter helps in identifying the bombmaker Mukhtar Ansari, who is hiding in Shivgarh. Sooryavanshi sends Inspector Sangram "Simmba" Bhalerao to arrest him. Simmba tells Surya that 7 bombs are to be planted at 7 locations in Mumbai. Riyaaz escapes, and it is revealed that the ATS's headquarters would also be bombed.
    
    Surya and his team enlist NSG's help to safely extradite the bombs via helicopters and the bombings get botched. However, Riyaaz and his team use Ria as a suicide bomber to attack the ATS headquarters keeping Surya, Simmba and the other cops as hostages. Surya's friend DCP Bajirao Singham arrives and they defuse the bomb wrapped around Ria while killing all the terrorists. They capture Mukhtar, Riyaaz and his younger brother Raza who taunt Singham, Simmba, and Surya that they have been in India as sleeper cells for many years, carrying several attacks in Mumbai, and that the police cannot harm them. An enraged Singham, Simmba, and Surya shoot them to death, thus bringing peace in Mumbai.

        Produced on a budget of ₹100 crore, K.G.F: Chapter 2 is the most expensive Kannada film ever made. Neel retained the technicians from its predecessor with Bhuvan Gowda handling the cinematography and Ravi Basrur composed the film score and songs. Dutt and Tandon joined the cast in early 2019, marking the former's Kannada film debut. Portions of the film were shot back-to-back with Chapter 1. Principal photography for the rest of the sequences commenced in March 2019, but was halted in February 2020 owing to the COVID-19 lockdown in India. Filming resumed five months later and was completed in December 2020. Locations included Bangalore, Hyderabad, Mysore and Kolar.
        
        K.G.F: Chapter 2 was theatrically released in India on 14 April 2022 in Kannada, along with dubbed versions in Hindi, Telugu, Tamil and Malayalam languages. It is also the first Kannada film to release in IMAX. The film received mixed reviews from critics, who praised the direction, action sequences, cinematography and performances (particularly Yash, Dutt and Tandon), but the pace and writing attracted criticism. It recorded the second highest-opening day in India, set domestic opening day records in Kannada, Hindi and Malayalam, and surpassed the lifetime gross of its predecessor in two days to become the highest-grossing Kannada film. With earnings of ₹1,200–1,250 crore globally,[20] K.G.F: Chapter 2 is the fourth highest-grossing Indian film worldwide, and the second highest-grossing film in India, and the second-highest-grossing Indian film of 2022.
        
        Plot
        After detailing the events in K.G.F: Chapter 1, Anand Ingalagi suffers a stroke and his son, Vijayendra, takes over to narrate the rest of the story. Rocky kills heir apparent Virat and takes over the K.G.F, keeping Reena hostage to ensure the cooperation of Guru Pandian, Andrews, Rajendra Desai, Kamal and Daya. But when Rocky showed his arrogance in front of everyone and demand to take Reena as his wife, Kamal got enraged and protests against Rocky. This leads Rocky to kill Kamal in front of everyone. He issues orders to start work in eight hidden mines. Meanwhile, Adheera resurfaces and kills all guards at an outpost. In a ruse to bring Rocky to Adheera, Andrews kills Desai to lure Reena outside K.G.F, and John captures Reena. Adheera shoots Rocky but spares his life, while his men roadblock all gold exports from K.G.F.
        
        Meanwhile, Shetty ties up with other subordinates of Andrews across India's western coast and exterminates Rocky's allies with Inayat Khalil's newfound support, but Rocky's aides kill Shetty's associates and recapture the coast. A recuperated Rocky, along with Reena, visits Dubai to deal in gold with Khalil, and also buys Kalashnikovs from him. Rocky and his gang gravely wound Adheera and kill his henchmen with their newly acquired weapons. Exasperated with K.G.F, some central ministers had planned a no-confidence motion against the DYSS-supported government to bring Ramika Sen in power, but Rocky's henchmen threaten other ministers against the vote and the motion fails. Rocky also kills Shetty, gaining control over Bombay. Pandian warns Rocky of Sen's rising stature, but he disregards him.
        
        In 1981, Ramika Sen wins the Indian general elections and becomes Prime Minister. After CBI officer Kanneganti Raghavan briefs her about the situation in K.G.F, she issues orders to close all state borders and authorises Raghavan to raid Rocky's warehouses. A young Ingalagi is caught spying by Rocky's henchmen, but Rocky is impressed by his integrity. The CBI find nothing in their raids save for a 400 gram-gold bar. Rocky retrieves it from a police station and singlehandedly destroyed the police station using a M2 Browning machine gun. Rocky halts all exports from K.G.F, which strains relations with Khalil, but continues the mining. His aides trace his biological father, a drunkard who abandoned his family, and pays the unaware man to take care of Shanti's newly shifted grave. Reena confesses her feelings to Rocky and they get married.
        
        Rocky meets with Sen and hands her a file exposing his involvement in money laundering, but she cannot consider it as almost all her party members are complicit in the corruption. Still furious after his defeat, Adheera makes his way to K.G.F through a secret passage with Andrews, Daya and John, supported by Khalil's armada. Just as Reena reveals her pregnancy to Rocky, Adheera fatally snipes her. In the ensuing clash, Rocky's army kill Andrews and Daya, while Rocky kills John and chokes Adheera to death. Rocky and his henchmen disrupt Sen's speech at the Parliament and kill Pandian (who had staged the attack on
