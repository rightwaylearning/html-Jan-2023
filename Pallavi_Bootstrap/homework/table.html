                <td><p class="text-justify"> The bespectacled teenager gave up science in school, and a probable career in hospitality, and has no regrets whatsoever. After all, she is only the second Indian cricketer to feature in a foreign T20 league, has a World Cup century against her name, another one in Australia, a double ton in domestic one-day competition. All at the age of 20!

                    As a nine-year-old, Mandhana signed up for cricket trials for fun. She'd accompanied her older brother for enough of those sessions to pick up left-handed batting even though she is otherwise right-handed. At just 11, she was fast-tracked to the Maharashtra Uunder-19 side and four years later, to the senior team. The youngster announced herself at the domestic stage with a stunning 155 on debut against Saurashtra.

                <td><p class="text-justify">The youngest-ever to play T20I cricket for India, Shefali Verma shot to fame during the women's exhibition match that was played towards the fag end of IPL 2019. Batting at the top of the order, she showed admirable gumption for a 15-year-old and despite not scoring a lot of runs, her immense confidence and clarity in shot-selection impressed one and all. Shefali also shone in the Women's T20 Challenge that happened later in the year and consquently got picked for the National team in the home T20Is against South Africa. Shefali's biggest strength is her fearless nature of gameplay and could be the perfect successor to Smriti Mandhana. Not many know that Shefali had to disguise as a boy during her childhood to train as there was no academy for girls in her native place, Rohtak. Her father reluctantly agreed to this plan despite the obvious fear of being caught. Having idolised Sachin Tendulkar, Shefali is also a huge fan of AB de Villiers. Her attacking style of play as an opener is obviously an afteraffect of Virender Sehwag's legacy.

                <td><p class="text-justify">A classy top-order batsman from the Mumbai school of batsmanship, Jemima Rodrigues is arguably the finest next-generation talent in the Indian women's team at present. The amount of time that she has at her disposal to play shots and the effortless power-hitting skills in particular make her special. She made her international debut in 2018 across ODIs and T20Is, and quite steadily has become the second most reliable batsman in the shortest format after Smriti Mandhana. Her 50-over game is still a work-in-progress in comparison but there is no doubt that Jemima will master it sooner than later.

Indian women's circuit has her childhood coach Kamaldish Singh Sodhi to thank, who instinctively decided to build a girls' team from scratch after spotting an otherwise timid girl plonk the balls out of the park so effortlessly.

Lost in the narrative of comebacks, collapses and fightbacks in India's stirring 107-run victory over Pakistan in their 2022 World Cup opener was his daughter's small yet significant contribution.

Some might even single you out for being, perhaps, the only nerd in the group. Deepti Bhagwan Sharma - the versatile of versatilities in a game that she deeply loves - may not fit the modernized and ever-changing definition of trendy, but the star Indian all-rounder had her priorities set, in life of course, at a time when most of her fellow beings got busy schooling their brains regarding the brewing perks of social media.</p></td>
