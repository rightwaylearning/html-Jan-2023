            Baazigar (transl. Gambler) is a 1993 Indian Hindi-language romantic thriller film directed by Abbas–Mustan and produced by Venus Movies. It stars Shah Rukh Khan and Kajol in lead roles, while Raakhee, Shilpa Shetty, Dalip Tahil, Siddharth Ray, and Johnny Lever appear in supporting roles, with the soundtrack composed by Anu Malik. The film is about a young man seeking to avenge the fall of his family. The story is loosely based on Ira Levin's 1953 novel A Kiss Before Dying and its 1991 film adaptation of the same name.[1]
            
            This was Khan's breakthrough role as the sole lead (his first as an anti-hero), along with being his eighth film out of eighty throughout his 30-year career, Kajol's first commercial success and Shetty's film debut.[2][3]
            
            Baazigar was released on 12 November 1993, coinciding with the festival of Diwali.[4] Made on a budget of ₹40 million, the film was declared a success at the box office with a worldwide gross of ₹320 million.[5] Apart from emerging as a major financial success, the film has become a cult film over years due to its suspense, story, screenplay, soundtrack and performances of the cast.[6] It was the first collaboration between Khan and Kajol, who went on to become one of India's most iconic on-screen couples. It helped establish Khan, Kajol, Shetty and Malik in Hindi films, and the soundtrack sold over 10 million units, thus becoming the highest-selling album of the year.[7]
            
            At the 39th Filmfare Awards, Baazigar received 10 nominations, including Best Film, Best Supporting Actress and Best Female Debut (both for Shetty), and won 4 awards, including Best Actor (Khan) and Best Music Director (Malik).[8]
            
            A Telugu remake, Vetagadu, was released in 1995,[9] before a Tamil remake, Samrat, was released in 1997 and a Kannada remake, Nagarahavu, was released in 2002.[10]
