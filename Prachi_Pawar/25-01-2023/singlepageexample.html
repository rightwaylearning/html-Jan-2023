While trying to get money to get into a cricket team, he runs into Nisha, and after some misunderstandings, they become close and fall in love. However, they are later separated by Nisha's parents, whose father is a strict Naval officer and disciplinarian, along with the circumstances that plague them. Nisha, who promises to return to Satya, never comes back. Satya falls into depression, turning to alcohol, and pushing away his dream of becoming a cricketer.

Meanwhile, Shravani, Satya's neighbour, had been in love with Satya, since their childhood, of which he is unaware of. When she learnt of Satya's love for Nisha, she started distancing herself from him, but marries him a few years later, after sensing his and Dinkar's pain. However, Satya married Shravani due to pressure from his father, not out of love. He does not work and instead, relives his memories of Nisha. He relies on Shravani's salary, for money to buy alcohol, from the Indian Railways.

When Satya goes to Delhi to help select some cricket players from a youth team, he encounters Khushi, Nisha's daughter. He learns from Nisha's father, that Nisha and her husband, Kunal, died in an accident. Heartbroken, Satya agrees to take Khushi in, as an adopted father, after Nisha's father requests him to, as it was Nisha's wish. He takes Khushi back to Mumbai for cricket training. After letting his family know of the situation, Satya and Shravani both decide to adopt Khushi. However, Khushi says that she will only agree to becoming their adopted daughter, only if, Satya and Shravani sort out their problems and not distance themselves, to which they agree to.

       Here Adilshah's army was in pursuit with an army of 10,000. Then, Shivaji Maharaj decided to split his forces. Baji Prabhu Deshpande (Ajay Purkar) agreed to face Adilshah's troops with 300 soldiers. Shivaji Maharaj told him that he would hear cannons being fired 5 times, signaling Shivaji Maharaj's safety.
       
       Baji Prabhu occupied Ghodkhind, blocking the path of Adilshah troops. His brother, Fulaji, Rayaji Bandal, Shambusingh Jadhav, Aginya were present with him. Fulaji, Aginya, Rayaji and Shambusingh were killed after fierce fight. Baji Prabhu were wounded but carried on fighting at Ghodkhind. Five hours after starting the battle, the cannons were fired announcing that Shivaji Maharaj safely returned to Vishalgad.

     <h4 id="id5">Locha Zala Re</h4>
     <p>
        In order to increase his allowance, Aditya, who settled in Birmingham has written to his uncle staying in Satara, that he is married although he is a bachelor. One-day uncle drops in unexpectedly in Birmingham. And Aditya is drawn into the vertex of intrigue when Uncle mistakes Pooja, Aditya's Best friend Manav's wife, as Aditya's wife & the neighbor's Ruby as Manav's wife. Aditya is basically honest and does not wish to deceive his uncle but.. does he have a choice. The Uncle is impressed by Pooja and also decides to steps up Aditya's allowance for choosing a pretty & sweet girl like Pooja to be his wife. Uncle also promises Pooja that he will step up the allowance further if they have a baby. This leaves Aditya with no choice but to carry on this act, very much to Manav Patel's discomfort. 

        Further complications arise when Ruby, the neighbor PK's wife drops in at the house, and Uncle mistakes her for Manav's wife.   Complications keep tumbling when the nightfall's, and it's time to retire. Who goes to bed with whom? Manav is irked when Aditya suggests that since the Uncle is home, he (Aditya) will have to spend the night with Pooja and is further annoyed when he (Manav) has to spend the night in the Maid's room.
        
        The situation reaches its climax when Uncle nearly catches Manav sneaking into Aditya & Pooja's room.   But the plot becomes more hilarious when the next-door drunkard neighbor P.K. drops in the bed with Uncle and is mistaken for someone else. The indescribable confusion that follows builds into a rich complexity of mistaken identities, splendid farcical situations, and a climax of comic wizardry.
        
        From here on the permutations become so intricate that it seems impossible that Aditya, Pooja & Manav can ever sort them out. But miraculously they do, so hilariously that the audience will keep rolling with laughter till the movie ends. A fast, funny plot makes this rip-roaring farce easy & enjoyable for the entire family.
