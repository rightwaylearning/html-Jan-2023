        <dt>Shafali Verma</dt>
        <dd>The youngest-ever to play T20I cricket for India, Shefali Verma shot to fame during the women's exhibition match that was played towards the fag end of IPL 2019. Batting at the top of the order, she showed admirable gumption for a 15-year-old and despite not scoring a lot of runs, her immense confidence and clarity in shot-selection impressed one and all. Shefali also shone in the Women's T20 Challenge that happened later in the year and consquently got picked for the National team in the home T20Is against South Africa. Shefali's biggest strength is her fearless nature of gameplay and could be the perfect successor to Smriti Mandhana. Not many know that Shefali had to disguise as a boy during her childhood to train as there was no academy for girls in her native place, Rohtak. Her father reluctantly agreed to this plan despite the obvious fear of being caught. Having idolised Sachin Tendulkar, Shefali is also a huge fan of AB de Villiers. Her attacking style of play as an opener is obviously an afteraffect of Virender Sehwag's legacy.

        <dt>Smriti Mandhana</dt>
        <dd> The bespectacled teenager gave up science in school, and a probable career in hospitality, and has no regrets whatsoever. After all, she is only the second Indian cricketer to feature in a foreign T20 league, has a World Cup century against her name, another one in Australia, a double ton in domestic one-day competition. All at the age of 20!

            As a nine-year-old, Mandhana signed up for cricket trials for fun.</dd>

        <dt>Harmanpreet Kaur</dt>
        <dd>For someone who idolises the likes of Virender Sehwag, watching Ajinkya Rahane practice came to the rescue during a prolonged lean patch. Imbibing the values of patience, Hamranpreet remodelled her game, yet again, striking a perfect balance between aggression and caution. Learning, she says, never stops.

            2016-17 had been a breakthrough season for Harmanpreet who was handed the captaincy reigns in the wake of a disastrous World T20 campaign at home.</dd>
