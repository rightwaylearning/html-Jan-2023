        The bespectacled teenager gave up science in school, and a probable career in hospitality, and has no regrets whatsoever. After all, she is only the second Indian cricketer to feature in a foreign T20 league, has a World Cup century against her name, another one in Australia, a double ton in domestic one-day competition. All at the age of 20!

        As a nine-year-old, Mandhana signed up for cricket trials for fun. She'd accompanied her older brother for enough of those sessions to pick up left-handed batting even though she is otherwise right-handed. At just 11, she was fast-tracked to the Maharashtra Uunder-19 side and four years later, to the senior team. The youngster announced herself at the domestic stage with a stunning 155 on debut against Saurashtra.
        
        Mandhana made a 50 on Test debut, playing a crucial hand in India's historic Test win in England in 2014. She didn't do justice to her talent in two successive editions of the World T20, and in the debut WBBL stint, but lit up the 2017 World Cup with two scintillating knocks after spending over five months out of action due to an ACL tear.
        
        With one spot in foreign players' list for the second edition of ECB's Women's Cricket League still up for grabs, Mandhana's assault on England on her World Cup debut came as a timely reminder of her capabilities.

        The youngest-ever to play T20I cricket for India, Shefali Verma shot to fame during the women's exhibition match that was played towards the fag end of IPL 2019. Batting at the top of the order, she showed admirable gumption for a 15-year-old and despite not scoring a lot of runs, her immense confidence and clarity in shot-selection impressed one and all. Shefali also shone in the Women's T20 Challenge that happened later in the year and consquently got picked for the National team in the home T20Is against South Africa. Shefali's biggest strength is her fearless nature of gameplay and could be the perfect successor to Smriti Mandhana. Not many know that Shefali had to disguise as a boy during her childhood to train as there was no academy for girls in her native place, Rohtak. Her father reluctantly agreed to this plan despite the obvious fear of being caught. Having idolised Sachin Tendulkar, Shefali is also a huge fan of AB de Villiers. Her attacking style of play as an opener is obviously an afteraffect of Virender Sehwag's legacy.

    <h4 id="id3">Jemimah Rodrigues</h4>
    <p>
        A classy top-order batsman from the Mumbai school of batsmanship, Jemima Rodrigues is arguably the finest next-generation talent in the Indian women's team at present. The amount of time that she has at her disposal to play shots and the effortless power-hitting skills in particular make her special. She made her international debut in 2018 across ODIs and T20Is, and quite steadily has become the second most reliable batsman in the shortest format after Smriti Mandhana. Her 50-over game is still a work-in-progress in comparison but there is no doubt that Jemima will master it sooner than later. Like a few others of the new generation of players, she is also a fine fielder who is comfortable anywhere on the park.

Born into a sports family, Jemima's father was a junior coach in cricket at her own school. From a very young age, she showed a penchant for the game and played actively in her courtyard with her twin brothers. Jemima was gifted not only in cricket but also in hockey where she represented Maharashtra in the U17 category. She was often mentioned that her hockey skills have helped a bit in her power-hitting when it comes to cricket, the bottom hand allowing her to generate maximum force while trying the big hits. Jemima was only 13 when she made it to the U19 Maharashtra cricket team and it's been racy progress since then. With age, she should only get better and wiser, thereby becoming a more polished cricketer.

    <h4 id="id4">Harmanpreet Kaur</h4>
    <p>
        For someone who idolises the likes of Virender Sehwag, watching Ajinkya Rahane practice came to the rescue during a prolonged lean patch. Imbibing the values of patience, Hamranpreet remodelled her game, yet again, striking a perfect balance between aggression and caution. Learning, she says, never stops.

2016-17 had been a breakthrough season for Harmanpreet who was handed the captaincy reigns in the wake of a disastrous World T20 campaign at home. Though she lost her first assignment in charge - a three-match home series against reigning world champions in the format, Windies - Harmanpreet led India to their sixth straight Asia Cup crown, without dropping a game soon after.

Harmanpreet became the first Indian cricketer, male or female, to be roped in by a foreign T20 league when as many as three WBBL teams calling to sign the aggressive middle order bat. She ended up with inaugural champions Sydney Thunder and won the franchise's Player of the Tournament award for her all-round show in the debut season. Months later, the T20 captain became the first Indian to sign up with Surrey Stars for the second edition of ECB's Women's Cricket League.
