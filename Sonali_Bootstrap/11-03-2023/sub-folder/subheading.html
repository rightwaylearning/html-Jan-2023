            <p class="text-justify text-secondary">The earliest reported Women's Day observance, called "National Woman's Day",[13] was held on February 28, 1909, in New York City, organized by the Socialist Party of America[14] at the suggestion of activist Theresa Malkiel.[15] There have been claims that the day was commemorating a protest by women garment workers in New York on March 8, 1857, but researchers have alleged this to be a myth intended to detach International Women's Day from its socialist origin.[16][17][18]

                In August 1910, an International Socialist Women's Conference was organized ahead of the general meeting of the Socialist Second International in Copenhagen, Denmark.[19] However, what made history for the modern celebration of International Women's Day, according to the ILO, was the fire at the Triangle Shirtwaist factory in New York City on March 25, 1911, which killed 146 young workers, most of whom were immigrants.[20]
                
                Inspired in part by the American socialists, German delegates Clara Zetkin, KÃ¤te Duncker, Paula Thiede, and others proposed the establishment of an annual "Women's Day", although no date was specified.[8][16][21] The 100 delegates, representing 17 countries, agreed with the idea as a strategy to promote equal rights, including women's suffrage.[22]</p>
