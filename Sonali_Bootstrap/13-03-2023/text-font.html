        <p class="lead">The earliest reported Women's Day observance, called "National Woman's Day",[13] was held on February 28, 1909, in New York City, organized by the Socialist Party of America[14] at the suggestion of activist Theresa Malkiel.[15] There have been claims that the day was commemorating a protest by women garment workers in New York on March 8, 1857, but researchers have alleged this to be a myth intended to detach International Women's Day from its socialist origin.[16][17][18]</p>
        <p>Inspired in part by the American socialists, German delegates Clara Zetkin, KÃ¤te Duncker, Paula Thiede, and others proposed the establishment of an annual "Women's Day", although no date was specified.[8][16][21] The 100 delegates, representing 17 countries, agreed with the idea as a strategy to promote equal rights, including women's suffrage.[22]

            The following year, on March 19, 1911, the first International Women's Day was marked by over a million people in Austria, Denmark, Germany, and Switzerland.[14] In Austria-Hungary alone, there were 300 demonstrations,[16] with women parading on the Ringstrasse in Vienna, carrying banners honoring the martyrs of the Paris Commune.[16] Across Europe, women demanded the right to vote and to hold public office, and protested against employment sex discrimination.[4]</p>
