    <h1>The Maratha Empire</h1>
    <p>Pune was part of the Jagir (fiefdom) granted to Maloji Bhosale in 1599 for his services to the Nizamshahi
        (Ahmadnagar Sultanate).<br><br>
        [41] Pune was ruled by the Ahmadnagar Sultanate until it was annexed by the Mughals in the 17th century. Maloji
        Bhosale's grandson, Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj,
        the founder of the Maratha Empire, was born at the fort of Shivneri, about 90 km from Pune.[42] It changed hands
        several times between the Mughals and the Marathas in
        the period 1680 to 1705.
