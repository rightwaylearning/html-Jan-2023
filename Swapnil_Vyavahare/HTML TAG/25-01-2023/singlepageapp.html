    <H3>Sachin Ramesh Tendulkar BR (/ˌsʌtʃɪn tɛnˈduːlkər/ (listen); pronounced [sət͡ʃin t̪eːɳɖulkəɾ]; born 24 April
        1973)
        is an Indian former international cricketer who captained the Indian national team. He is regarded as one of the
        greatest batsmen in the history of cricket.[4] He is the all-time highest run-scorer in both ODI and Test
        cricket with more than 18000 runs and 15000 runs respectively in total.[5] He also holds the record for
        receiving the most man-of-the-match awards in international cricket.[6] Known for his large fanbase and
        described by ESPNcricinfo as 'the most worshipped player in the world',[7] Tendulkar is sometimes referred to as
        "The God of Cricket" in India. A film with that name was released in 2021.[8]

        Tendulkar took up cricket at the age of eleven, made his Test match debut on 15 November 1989 against Pakistan
        in Karachi at the age of sixteen, and went on to represent Mumbai domestically and India internationally for
        close to twenty-four years. In 2002, halfway through his career, Wisden ranked him the second-greatest Test
        batsman of all time, behind Don Bradman, and the second-greatest ODI batsman of all time, behind Viv
        Richards.[9] Later in his career, Tendulkar was part of the Indian team that won the 2011 Cricket World Cup, his
        first win in six World Cup appearances for India.[10] He had previously been named "Player of the Tournament" at
        the 2003 edition of the tournament.

        Tendulkar received the Arjuna Award in 1994 for his outstanding sporting achievements, the Khel Ratna Award,
        India's highest sporting honour, in 1997, and the Padma Shri and Padma Vibhushan awards in 1999 and 2008,
        respectively, two of India's highest civilian awards.[11][12] A few hours after the end of his last match in
        November 2013, the Prime Minister's Office announced the decision to award him the Bharat Ratna, India's highest
        civilian award.[13][14] As of 2021, he is the youngest recipient to date and was the first sportsperson to
        receive the award.[15][16] In 2012, Tendulkar was nominated to the Rajya Sabha, the upper house of the
        Parliament of India.</H3>
