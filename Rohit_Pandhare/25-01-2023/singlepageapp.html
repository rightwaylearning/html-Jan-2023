        In 2000, Raina decided to play cricket and subsequently moved from his hometown Muradnagar, Ghaziabad district
        to Lucknow, to attend the Guru Gobind Singh Sports College, Lucknow.[16] He rose to become the captain of the
        Uttar Pradesh U-16s and came to prominence amongst Indian selectors in 2002 when he was selected at the age of
        15+1⁄2 years for the U-19 tour to England, where he made a pair of half-centuries in the U-19 Test matches.[18]
        He toured Sri Lanka later that year with the U-17 team.

        He made his Ranji Trophy debut for Uttar Pradesh against Assam in February 2003 at the age of 16 but did not
        play another match until the following season. He debuted in List A Cricket against Madhya Pradesh at Indore in
        2005 and scored 16 runs.[19] He played for India green, UP under 16, India Blue, India Red, Rest of India, India
        under 19, Indian board's president's XI, Rajasthan Cricket association's president's XI, India seniors, Central
        zone.[20] In Ranji trophy 2005-06 season he scored 620 in 6 games.[21] In 2018 Akshdeep Nath replaced him as
        UP's Ranji trophy captain due to poor performance of scoring 105 runs in 9 innings averaging 11.66.[22]

        In late 2003, he toured Pakistan for the U-19 Asian ODI Championship before being selected for the 2004 U-19
        World Cup, where he scored three half-centuries, including a 90 scored off only 38 balls. He was then awarded a
        Border-Gavaskar scholarship to train at the Australian Cricket Academy and in early 2005, he made his
        first-class limited overs debut, and scored 645 runs that season at an average of 53.75.[23]

        Talent – an apparently heartening term that has followed Rohit Sharma around like a shadow; even haunted him at
        times. It seems to be a burden that the cricketing fraternity has enforced upon him and, after more than a
        decade in the national setting, he has been weighed down by the label.

        Harsha Bhogle spoke of whispers in the domestic circuit; of coaches and scouts spotting the effortless,
        free-flowing stroke-play of a Mumbai teenager. Having cruised through first-class cricket, with an average well
        above 50, he shot to the limelight when he scored a brisk unbeaten triple-hundred at the Ranji level.
        Rohit Gurunath Sharma (born 30 April 1987) is an Indian international cricketer and the current captain of the
        Indian cricket team. Considered as one of the best opening batters of all time,[2] Rohit is known for his
        timing, elegance, six-hiting abilities and leadership skills. He plays as a right-handed batsman for India
        national cricket team in international cricket, Mumbai Indians in IPL and for Mumbai in domestic cricket. Rohit
        also captains Mumbai Indians and the team has won 5 titles under his leadership, the most by any team.


        Sharma currently holds the world record for the highest individual score (264) in a One Day International (ODI)
        match and is the only player to have scored three double-centuries in ODIs and also holds the record for scoring
        most hundreds (five) in a single Cricket World Cup, for which he won the ICC Men's ODI Cricketer of the Year
        award in 2019. Sharma has received two national honours, the Arjuna Award in 2015 and the prestigious Major
        Dhyan Chand Khel Ratna in 2020.

        Outside cricket, Sharma is an active supporter of animal welfare campaigns. He is the official Rhino Ambassador
        for WWF-India and is a member of People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA). He has worked with PETA in
        its campaign to raise awareness of the plight of homeless cats and dogs in India.

    <p>
        Shubman Gill is the latest prodigy of India's familial batting production line. He shot to fame with 418 runs at
        an average of 104.50 in the 2018 ICC U19 World Cup, where he served as Prithvi Shaw's deputy and batted at No. 3
        to play a crucial role in India's record fourth world title. Also the edition's Player of the Tournament, Gill
        was a favourite in the 2018 IPL auctions and was picked by Kolkata Knight Riders for INR 1.8 crore (USD
        280,000).

        Born in Fazilka, Punjab, Gill's precocious talents found an early fan in his father, Lakhwinder Singh, who
        shifted base to Mohali and rented a place near the PCA Stadium so that his son could grow up with better access
        to cricket. And it wasn't long until Gill started grabbing headlines. He scored 351 in Punjab's Inter-District
        U16 tournament in 2014, racking up an opening stand of 587 with Nirmal Singh, and then went on to strike a
        double hundred in his U16 debut for Punjab at the 2016 Vijay Merchant Trophy.
        Shubman Gill (born 8 September 1997) is an Indian international cricketer who plays for Punjab in domestic
        cricket as a right-handed opening batsman.[2][3] He was the vice-captain of the India U-19 team for 2018
        Under-19 Cricket World Cup.[4] He got awarded with Player of The Tournament for same U-19 Cricket World cup. He
        is the youngest cricketer to score a double century in ODI cricket.

        He made his List-A debut against Vidharbha[5] in 2017 and first-class debut for Punjab against Bengal in the
        2017–18 Ranji Trophy, in late 2017, with a half-century in the game,[6] and 129 runs in the LAST match against
        Services.[7] He made his international debut for the Indian cricket team in January 2019.[2]

        He was drafted into India's Under-19 side as the vice-captain for the 2018 Under-19 Cricket World Cup. Shubman
        scored 372 runs at an average of 124.00 at the tournament, where he batted at number three to play a crucial
        role in India's record fourth world title and was adjudged the edition's Player of the Tournament.[8] His
        match-winning 102 not out in the semi-final against arch-rivals Pakistan U-19 drew praises from batting greats
        such as Rahul Dravid, Sachin Tendulkar, VVS Laxman, and Sourav Ganguly.[9][10]

        He soon joined the senior Men in Blue in Sri Lanka, come August 2008. In the absence of the regular openers,
        Virat Kohli was given a chance to open the batting in the ODI series. He played some commendable knocks in his
        extended run as an opener, as India went on to win the ODI series. However, the established and formidable pair
        of Tendulkar and Sehwag kept Kohli out of the team

        The 20-year-old continued to impress for Delhi and dominated attacks, clearly demonstrating that he belonged at
        a much higher level; that junior cricket was beneath his standards. Kohli then traveled to Australia in 2009 for
        the Emerging players tournament and stamped his authority all over the bowling attacks. He added 'big-match
        temperament' to his résumé too, lacing a fluent hundred in the final against South Africa, and guiding his team
        to a clinical victory. The young prodigy, barely old enough to receive his man-of-the-match champagne, ended the
        tournament with 398 runs from 7 outings with two centuries and two fifties, ensuring that he remained fresh in
        the selectors' minds.

        Prodigies aren't uncommon in Indian cricket. What's unusual in Ishan Kishan's journey is the fact that it's
        roots originate in Jharkhand. With MS Dhoni - the biggest and perhaps only noteworthy name to have come out of
        the newly carved out state, it's no surprise that the young kid took to become a wicket-keeping batsman.

        A left-handed opener, Kishan's first claim to fame came in 2016 when he was picked to lead the India under-19s
        for the u-19 World Cup held in Dhaka. Despite a lean run with the bat (73 runs in six innings), in a tournament
        where Rishabh Pant lit up the scoring charts, he took India to the finals. He was however quick to turn his
        fortunes around in the domestic Ranji season that was to follow - ending up as Jharkhand's leading run-scorer
        with 799 runs. That included a career best 273 against Delhi, the highest till date by a Jharkhand batsman.

        In the post-Dhoni era in Indian cricket, he's thrown his hat into the club of wicketkeeper-batsmen waiting in
        the wings to replace him.

        Suryakumar Yadav made his first-class debut against Delhi during the 2010-11 Ranji season. He had a great start

        every season.

        Impressed by his talent, he received an IPL contract from Mumbai Indians in 2011, for whom he played a few IPL
        matches until 2013. He moved to Kolkata Knight Riders and was very handy lower down the order and played a few
