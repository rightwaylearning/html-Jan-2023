                K.G.F: Chapter 1 is a 2018 Indian Kannada-language period action film[5] written and directed by Prashanth Neel, and produced by Vijay Kiragandur under the banner of Hombale Films.

Filmed on a budget of ₹800 million (equivalent to ₹910 million or US$11 million in 2020), it was the most expensive Kannada film at the time of its release.[2] The film focuses on Rocky, a high-ranking mercenary, working for a leading gold mafia in Mumbai, who was born in poverty. After being offered the total control of Mumbai by his employer's boss, he disguises himself as a slave-laborer in the Narachi limestone mine (Kolar Gold Fields), aiming to assassinate Garuda, the future heir of Kolar Gold Fields.

                The film's development began in early 2015, after Neel finished writing the screenplay.[6] Filming began two years later, in January 2017. Most of the film is set in the Kolar Gold Fields and was filmed in locales such as Kolar, Mysore, and parts of North Karnataka. The film's production was completed in August 2018.[7] Bhuvan Gowda handled the cinematography and Srikanth Gowda edited the film. Composer Ravi Basrur scored the film.[8]
